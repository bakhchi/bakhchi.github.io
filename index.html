            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hi, I'm Zach. I currently attend Cooper Union as an Electrical Engineering major. I am passionate about exploring different fields of technology and applying my skills to solve real-world problems. Whether it involves programming, computer and network infrastructure, or AI, my journey has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of various technologies, and I take pride in adapting to new challenges and delivering impactful results. I like building things; finding new solutions and collaborating with others motivates me to keep building in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not working on school work or ongoing projects, I enjoy going to the gym, playing chess, solving puzzles, and listen to music. My favorite movies are Revenge of The Sith, Interstellar, Whiplash, and Django Unchained.</p>
