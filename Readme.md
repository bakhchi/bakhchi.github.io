If you are reading this, welcome!

This is my personal website where I share my projects, experiences, and thoughts.

I'm a student at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

I'm passionate about exploring different branches of technology like programming, computer networks, and AI. Building and collaborating in technology drives my passion for continuous innovation and impactful solutions to real world problems.

Outside of school and projects, I enjoy the gym, chess, puzzles, music, and movies like Revenge of the Sith, Interstellar, Whiplash, and Django Unchained. This will be a space where I share whats new with life and showcase projects from both school and work.

I hope you enjoy your stay!

Zach
