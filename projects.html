            <li><strong>Network Diagram</strong> | Microsoft Visio (July 2023): Compiled documentation of network infrastructure at one of Ana’s mid-sized clients.

            <li><strong>Game Portfolio</strong> | C, Python, Git (Jan. 2024 – May 2024): Made games in Programming for Electrical Engineers, a basic computer science class at Cooper Union. Developed SOS, a game like Tic Tac Toe but with a greater degree of difficulty, programmed in C. Created Uno, the popular card game where friendships are destroyed, programmed in Python. Designed Wheel of Fortune, the well-known TV game show, programmed in Python.</li>
            <li><strong>TCB Copilot</strong> | Python, NodeJS, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, Git (June 2024 – Present): Created for The Conference Board (a client of Ana’s Cloud) allowing users to preview TCB’s subscription-based content.
